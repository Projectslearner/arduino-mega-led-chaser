# LED Chaser

#### Project Overview

The **LED Chaser** project creates a dynamic LED sequence using an Arduino Mega. LEDs are turned on and off in a sequence, simulating a chaser or "Knight Rider" effect. This project is excellent for learning about controlling multiple LEDs with Arduino and can be extended for various visual effects.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Mega**
- **8 LEDs**
- **8 Resistors (220Œ© recommended)**
- **Jumper Wires**
- **Breadboard**

#### Block Diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect the LEDs to Arduino Mega:**
   - **LED Anode (longer leg)**: Connect each to digital pins 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 via resistors.
   - **LED Cathode (shorter leg)**: Connect all to GND.

   Example connections:
   - LED 1: Anode to pin 2, Cathode to GND
   - LED 2: Anode to pin 3, Cathode to GND
   - Continue similarly for all 8 LEDs.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Assemble the circuit on the breadboard as described.
   - Ensure each LED is connected to the respective Arduino pin through a resistor to limit current.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Mega.
   - Observe the LEDs turn on and off in sequence, creating a chaser effect.

#### Applications

- **Decorative Lighting:** Create dynamic lighting effects for decorations or events.
- **Status Indicators:** Use chaser patterns to indicate system status or progress.
- **Learning Tool:** Understand how to control multiple outputs with Arduino.

#### Notes

- **Adjust Speed:** Modify the delay values in the code to speed up or slow down the LED chaser effect.
- **Extend the Project:** Add more LEDs or create different patterns by changing the code logic.
- **Power Considerations:** Ensure the Arduino can handle the current required by all LEDs, especially if using higher power LEDs.
